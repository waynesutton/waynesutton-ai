I build developer communities. At Convex, I run programs like Convex Champions and Convex For Startups, organize meetups, and manage our Discord.

I've spent 15 years doing this—100+ events across 50+ cities, working with startups and Fortune 500s. The goal is always the same: help developers connect, share feedback, and build things together.

When I'm not working, I'm on my adventure motorcycle or finding excuses to meet more founders and developers in person.

  <summary>Long Bio</summary>

I'm Wayne Sutton. I help startups build developer communities through strategy, events, and operations.

As Head of Community and Events at Convex, I lead Convex Champions and Convex For Startups, organize developer meetups with partners, and manage our Discord community. The goal: create a space where developers collaborate, get technical support, and showcase what they build.

I've spent over 15 years in this space. I've launched programs to support startups and developers, hosted virtual meetups and talks, and partnered with YouTube creators and influencers to help developers learn Convex and ship projects with it.

Events are core to what I do. I've organized and managed over 100 virtual and in-person events across 50+ cities, bringing together more than 50,000 attendees. I've run conferences with million-dollar budgets and partnered with organizations from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 companies. Every event I touch is designed to run smoothly and deliver real value to attendees.

Before Convex, I mentored startups, built programs to support emerging tech founders, and consulted with Fortune 500s on growth and marketing strategy.

Outside of work, I live in the Bay Area with my wife and cat. I ride my adventure motorcycle across California, stay active, and look for excuses to connect with founders and developers in person.
