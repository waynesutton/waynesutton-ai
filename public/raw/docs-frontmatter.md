## Common patterns

### Hide pages from navigation

Set `showInNav: false` to keep a page published and accessible via direct URL, but hidden from the navigation menu. Pages with `showInNav: false` remain searchable and available via API endpoints. Useful for pages you want to link directly but not show in the main nav.

### Unlisted posts and pages

Set `unlisted: true` to hide a post or page from all listings while keeping it live at its direct URL. Unlisted content is excluded from: blog listings (`/blog` page), navigation, featured sections, tag pages (`/tags/[tag]`), search results (Command+K), related posts, the sitemap, RSS feeds, and API listings. It also serves a `noindex, nofollow` robots meta tag and an `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header on API and raw markdown responses so Google will not index it. Anyone with the link can still view and share it. Your unlisted URLs are listed in the dashboard under Posts and Pages using the Unlisted filter tab, with a copy link button on each row. Unpublished (`published: false`) remains the only truly private state.

### Show image at top

Add `showImageAtTop: true` to display the `image` field at the top of the post/page above the header. Default behavior: if `showImageAtTop` is not set or `false`, image only used for Open Graph previews and featured card thumbnails.

### Image lightbox

Images in blog posts and pages automatically open in a full-screen lightbox when clicked (if enabled in `siteConfig.imageLightbox.enabled`). This allows readers to view images at full size. The lightbox can be closed by clicking outside the image, pressing Escape, or clicking the close button.

### Text alignment

Use `textAlign` field to control text alignment for page content. Options: `"left"` (default), `"center"`, or `"right"`. Used by `home.md` to control home intro alignment.

### Docs section

To add content to the docs sidebar:

1. Add `docsSection: true` to frontmatter
2. Optionally set `docsSectionGroup` to group related content
3. Use `docsSectionOrder` to control order within groups
4. Use `docsSectionGroupOrder` to control group order
5. Add `docsSectionGroupIcon` for visual icons (Phosphor icons)

### Docs landing page

Set `docsLanding: true` on one post or page to make it the docs landing page. This content displays when navigating to `/docs`.

### Slide presentations

Set `slides: true` on any post or page to enable presentation mode. A Present button appears in the post header. Clicking it opens a fullscreen overlay where each `---` horizontal rule in your markdown becomes a slide boundary. Navigate with arrow keys, space bar, or the on-screen buttons. Press Escape to exit. The post still renders normally as a readable article by default. See the [slide template example](/slide-template-example) for a working demo.
