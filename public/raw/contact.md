You found the contact page. Nice

## The technical way

This site runs on Convex, which means every page view is a live subscription to the database. You are not reading cached HTML. You are reading data that synced moments ago.

If you want to reach out, here is an idea: fork this repo, add a contact form, wire it to a Convex mutation, and deploy. Your message will hit the database in under 100ms. No email server required.
