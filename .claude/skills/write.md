## Rule of one

Every piece of content follows this framework:

**One person** — Write to a specific person, not an audience.

**One problem** — State the single problem they face.

**One cause** — Identify the root cause.

**One difference** — Explain what the solution does differently.

**One action** — End with one clear next step.

### Rule of one checklist

Before publishing, answer these:

- [ ] Can I name the one person this is for?
- [ ] Can the problem fit in one sentence?
- [ ] Is the root cause obvious?
- [ ] Can I explain the difference in one breath?
- [ ] Is there only one action at the end?

If any answer is no, revise before publishing. Ask the user if they want to proceed with the revision.

## Core principles

**Stand out by being you**
You don't stand out online by saying the same things as everyone else. You stand out by saying: "This is who I am. Here's what I think, feel, and believe." Consensus takes are forgettable. Your take isn't.

**Lead with value**
- First sentence does the work
- Don't bury the takeaway
- Readers scroll fast

**Be direct, not blunt**
- Say what you mean
- Confidence without arrogance
- Contractions are fine

**Technical, not alienating**
- Define terms when helpful
- Complex ideas deserve simple language
- Let code speak when it can

**Share what you actually know**
- Personal experience beats generic advice
- Specific examples beat abstract principles
- Acknowledge what you don't know

## AI detection avoidance

### Banned vocabulary

**Never use:**
delve, intricate, pivotal, comprehensive, multifaceted, facilitate, encompass, underscore, testament, notably, crucial, underpins, realm, landscape, tapestry, moreover, furthermore, additionally, specifically, importantly, consequently, therefore, thus, myriad, plethora, nuanced, holistic, meticulous, versatile, leverage, synergy, ecosystem, paradigm shift, disruptive, scalable, seamless, empower, innovative, transformative, robust, agile, dynamic, cutting-edge, next-gen, revolutionary, breakthrough, game changer, supercharge, unlock, groundbreaking, ai powered, ai-powered

**Banned sentence openers:**
- Dive into / Delve into
- It's important to note
- In conclusion / In summary
- Based on the information provided
- Navigating the landscape of
- A testament to
- When it comes to
- In today's digital age
- Furthermore / Moreover / Additionally
- Let's explore

### Banned patterns

**Rule of three**
AI groups items in threes. Vary list lengths.

BAD: "The project was innovative, comprehensive, and groundbreaking."
GOOD: "The project worked."

**Negative parallelisms**
BAD: "This is not just a tool, but a revolution."
GOOD: State what it IS directly.

**Vague attributions**
BAD: "Many experts believe..." / "Some argue that..."
GOOD: Name specific sources or remove attribution.

**Setup-pivot-conclusion paragraphs**
AI follows: General statement → "However" → Balanced conclusion.
Real writing is messier. Not every paragraph needs resolution.

**Symmetrical structures**
AI balances pros/cons equally. Real analysis is asymmetric.

### Banned style markers

- No em dashes between words
- No hashtags
- No emojis unless requested
- No title case ("The Future of AI" → "The future of AI")
- No excessive formatting

### How to write human

**Vary sentence structure**
Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones. Fragments work too. Questions help.

**Use specific details**
- Exact numbers over ranges
- Named sources over "experts say"
- Concrete examples over abstractions
- Personal observations

**Embrace asymmetry**
Real writing has uneven sections, stronger opinions, tangents, imperfect transitions.

**Show your thinking**
- "I tried X, but it didn't work because..."
- "The obvious answer is Y, but actually..."
- "I'm not sure about Z, but here's my take..."

## Before publishing checklist

### Rule of one check
- [ ] Can I name the one person this is for?
- [ ] Can the problem fit in one sentence?
- [ ] Is the root cause obvious?
- [ ] Can I explain the difference in one breath?
- [ ] Is there only one action at the end?

### Quality check
- [ ] Clear takeaway in first line?
- [ ] No banned vocabulary?
- [ ] No banned sentence openers?
- [ ] No rule of three patterns?
- [ ] No vague attributions?
- [ ] No setup-pivot-conclusion in every paragraph?
- [ ] No excessive em dashes?
- [ ] No perfectly balanced arguments?
- [ ] Formatted for the platform?
- [ ] Fact-checked?

**If any check fails, revise before publishing.**

## Core principle

You don't stand out by saying what everyone else says. You stand out by putting yourself in the work. What you think. What you feel. What you believe. That's the signal in the noise.

AI writes to sound authoritative. Humans write to communicate.

AI smooths rough edges. Human writing has texture.

AI balances everything. Human writing has opinions.

AI generalizes. Human writing gets specific.

Write like you're the smartest person at the table who doesn't need to prove it.

Be clear. Be useful. Be human. Have a point of view.

When in doubt: Would a tired expert at 11pm write this sentence? If it sounds too polished, too balanced, too careful, it probably is.
