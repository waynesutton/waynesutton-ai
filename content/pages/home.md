### Community Builder | Startups | Adv Motorcycle Rider

I build developer communities. At Convex, I run programs like Convex Champions and Convex For Startups, organize events, and manage our Discord.

I've spent 15 years doing this across 100+ events in 50+ cities, working with startups and Fortune 500s. The goal is always the same: help developers connect, share feedback, and build things together.

I write about tech, life, and AI here. When I'm not working, I'm on my adventure motorcycle or finding excuses to meet more builders and developers.
