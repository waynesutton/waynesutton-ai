Released January 9, 2026

**Footer not displaying on /docs landing page fix**

Fixed an issue where the footer was not displaying on the `/docs` landing page even when `showFooter: true` was set in the frontmatter. The `DocsPage.tsx` component (which handles the `/docs` route with `docsLanding: true`) was missing the Footer component entirely.

- Right sidebar now properly flush right at `right: 0`

**Core Web Vitals performance optimizations**

Fixes for PageSpeed Insights failures on mobile and desktop. These changes improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and eliminate non-composited animation warnings.

---

## v2.13.0

Released January 7, 2026

**Enhanced diff code block rendering**

Diff and patch code blocks now render with enhanced visualization powered by @pierre/diffs. This brings Shiki-based syntax highlighting specifically designed for showing code changes.

**Features:**

- Unified view (default): Single column with +/- indicators
- Split view: Side-by-side comparison of old and new code
- View toggle button to switch between modes
- Theme-aware colors matching dark/light/tan/cloud themes
- Copy button for copying raw diff content
- Automatic routing: Use `diff or `patch in markdown

**New documentation:**

---

## v2.12.0

Released January 7, 2026

**Canonical URL fix for search engines (GitHub Issue #6)**

Fixed a mismatch where raw HTML was showing the homepage canonical URL instead of the page-specific canonical URL. Search engines that check raw HTML before rendering JavaScript now receive the correct canonical tags.

**Changes:**

- Added search engine bot detection (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.) to serve pre-rendered HTML
- Search engines now receive correct canonical URLs in the initial HTML response
- Added SEO Bot Configuration documentation in FORK_CONFIG.md and setup-guide.md
- Bot detection arrays are easily customizable in `netlify/edge-functions/botMeta.ts`

**For forkers:**

The bot detection configuration is documented with clear comments at the top of `botMeta.ts`. You can customize which bots receive pre-rendered HTML by editing the `SOCIAL_PREVIEW_BOTS`, `SEARCH_ENGINE_BOTS`, and `AI_CRAWLERS` arrays.

---

## v2.11.0

Released January 6, 2026

**Ask AI header button with RAG-based Q&A**

New header button that opens a chat modal for asking questions about site content. Uses semantic search to find relevant posts and pages, then generates AI responses with source citations.

**Features:**

- Header button with sparkle icon (before search button)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+J or Cmd+/ (Mac), Ctrl+J or Ctrl+/ (Windows/Linux)
- Real-time streaming responses via Convex Persistent Text Streaming
- Model selector: Claude Sonnet 4 (default) or GPT-4o
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- Internal links use React Router for seamless navigation
- Source citations with links to referenced content
- Copy response button (hover to reveal) for copying AI answers
- Chat history within session (clears on page refresh)
- Clear chat button to reset conversation

**How it works:**

1. User question is stored in database with session ID
2. Query is converted to embedding using OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
3. Vector search finds top 5 relevant posts/pages
4. Content is sent to selected AI model with RAG system prompt
5. Response streams in real-time with source citations appended

**Configuration:**

Enable in `src/config/siteConfig.ts`:

```typescript
askAI: {
  enabled: true,
  defaultModel: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  models: [
    { id: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", name: "Claude Sonnet 4", provider: "anthropic" },
    { id: "gpt-4o", name: "GPT-4o", provider: "openai" },
  ],
},
```

**Requirements:**

- `semanticSearch.enabled: true` (for embeddings)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Convex (for embeddings)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Convex (for Claude models)
- Run `npm run sync` to generate embeddings

**Technical details:**

- New component: `src/components/AskAIModal.tsx`
- New Convex files: `convex/askAI.ts` (mutations/queries), `convex/askAI.node.ts` (HTTP action)
- New table: `askAISessions` with `by_stream` index
- HTTP endpoint: `/ask-ai-stream` for streaming responses
- Uses `@convex-dev/persistent-text-streaming` component
- Separated Node.js runtime (askAI.node.ts) from regular runtime (askAI.ts)

Updated files: `convex/schema.ts`, `convex/askAI.ts`, `convex/askAI.node.ts`, `convex/http.ts`, `convex/convex.config.ts`, `src/components/AskAIModal.tsx`, `src/components/Layout.tsx`, `src/config/siteConfig.ts`, `src/styles/global.css`

## v2.10.2

Released January 6, 2026

**SEO fixes for GitHub Issue #4**

Seven SEO issues resolved to improve search engine optimization:

1. **Canonical URL** - Dynamic canonical link tags added client-side for posts and pages
2. **Single H1 per page** - Markdown H1s demoted to H2 elements with `.blog-h1-demoted` class (maintains H1 visual styling)
3. **DOM order fix** - Article now loads before sidebar in DOM for better SEO (CSS `order` property maintains visual layout)
4. **X-Robots-Tag** - HTTP header added via netlify.toml (public routes indexed, dashboard/API routes noindexed)
5. **Hreflang tags** - Self-referencing hreflang (en, x-default) for language targeting
6. **og:url consistency** - Uses same canonicalUrl variable as canonical link tag
7. **twitter:site** - New `TwitterConfig` in siteConfig.ts for Twitter Cards

**Configuration:**

Add your Twitter handle in `src/config/siteConfig.ts`:

```typescript
twitter: {
  site: "@yourhandle",
  creator: "@yourhandle",
},
```

**Updated files:** `src/config/siteConfig.ts`, `src/pages/Post.tsx`, `src/components/BlogPost.tsx`, `src/styles/global.css`, `convex/http.ts`, `netlify.toml`, `index.html`, `fork-config.json.example`

## v2.10.1

Released January 5, 2026

**Optional semantic search configuration**

Semantic search can now be disabled via `siteConfig.semanticSearch.enabled`:

```typescript
semanticSearch: {
  enabled: false, // Disable semantic search, use keyword only
},
```

When disabled:

- Search modal shows only keyword search (no mode toggle)
- Embedding generation skipped during sync (saves API costs)
- Existing embeddings preserved in database (no data loss)

Default is `enabled: false` (keyword search only, no API key required). Set to `true` and configure OPENAI_API_KEY to enable semantic search.

Updated files: `src/config/siteConfig.ts`, `src/components/SearchModal.tsx`, `scripts/sync-posts.ts`, `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `FORK_CONFIG.md`, `fork-config.json.example`, `content/pages/docs-semantic-search.md`, `content/pages/docs.md`

## v2.10.0

Released January 5, 2026

**Semantic search with vector embeddings**

Search now supports two modes accessible via Cmd+K:

- **Keyword search** (existing) - Matches exact words using Convex full-text search. Instant, free, supports highlighting.
- **Semantic search** (new) - Finds content by meaning using OpenAI embeddings. Toggle to "Semantic" mode in search modal.

**How semantic search works:**

1. Your query is converted to a 1536-dimension vector using OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
2. Convex compares this vector to stored embeddings for all posts and pages
3. Results ranked by similarity score (displayed as percentage)
4. Top 15 results returned

**When to use each mode:**

| Use Case                                  | Mode     |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Specific code, commands, exact phrases    | Keyword  |
| Conceptual questions ("how do I deploy?") | Semantic |
| Need to highlight matches on page         | Keyword  |
| Not sure of exact terminology             | Semantic |

**Configuration:**

Semantic search requires an OpenAI API key:

```bash
npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY sk-your-key-here
npm run sync  # Generates embeddings for all content
```

If OPENAI_API_KEY is not configured, semantic search returns empty results and keyword search continues to work normally.

**Technical details:**

- New files: `convex/embeddings.ts`, `convex/embeddingsQueries.ts`, `convex/semanticSearch.ts`, `convex/semanticSearchQueries.ts`
- Added `embedding` field and `by_embedding` vector index to posts and pages tables
- SearchModal.tsx updated with Keyword/Semantic toggle (TextAa and Brain icons)
- Embeddings generated automatically during `npm run sync`
- Cost: ~$0.0001 per search query (embedding generation)

Updated files: `convex/schema.ts`, `convex/embeddings.ts`, `convex/embeddingsQueries.ts`, `convex/semanticSearch.ts`, `convex/semanticSearchQueries.ts`, `src/components/SearchModal.tsx`, `scripts/sync-posts.ts`, `src/styles/global.css`, `content/pages/docs-search.md`, `content/pages/docs-semantic-search.md`
