An open-source publishing framework built for AI agents and developers to ship websites, docs, or blogs. Two ways to publish: write markdown and sync from the terminal, or use the web dashboard. Your content is instantly available to browsers, LLMs, and AI agents. Built on Convex and Netlify.

I've spent 15 years doing this—100+ events across 50+ cities, working with startups and Fortune 500s. The goal is always the same: help developers connect, share feedback, and build things together.

**File-based content.** Posts and pages live in `content/blog/` and `content/pages/` as markdown files with frontmatter. Version controlled in your repo. The dashboard provides a web UI for creating and editing content directly in the database.

**Dashboard workflow.** Create and edit content at `/dashboard` without touching files. Dashboard content saves directly to the database with `source: "dashboard"` tracking. Export to markdown files with `npm run export:db` when needed.

**Sync commands:**

Sync command scripts are located in `scripts/` (sync-posts.ts, sync-discovery-files.ts).

**Development:**

- <span class="copy-command">npm run sync</span> - Sync markdown content
- <span class="copy-command">npm run sync:discovery</span> - Update discovery files (AGENTS.md, llms.txt)
- <span class="copy-command">npm run sync:all</span> - Sync content + discovery files together

Events are core to what I do. I've organized and managed over 100 virtual and in-person events across 50+ cities, bringing together more than 50,000 attendees. I've run conferences with million-dollar budgets and partnered with organizations from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 companies. Every event I touch is designed to run smoothly and deliver real value to attendees.

- <span class="copy-command">npm run sync:prod</span> - Sync markdown content
- <span class="copy-command">npm run sync:discovery:prod</span> - Update discovery files
- <span class="copy-command">npm run sync:all:prod</span> - Sync content + discovery files together

**Export dashboard content:**

- <span class="copy-command">npm run export:db</span> - Export dashboard posts/pages to content folders (development)
- <span class="copy-command">npm run export:db:prod</span> - Export dashboard posts/pages (production)

Outside of work, I live in the Bay Area with my wife and cat. I ride my adventure motorcycle across California, stay active, and look for excuses to connect with founders and developers in person.

**Dual source architecture.** File-synced content (`source: "sync"`) and dashboard content (`source: "dashboard"`) coexist. Neither overwrites the other. Use whichever workflow fits your needs.

## Who this is for

- Developers who want version-controlled content
- Teams comfortable with markdown and CLI
- Projects where AI agents generate content programmatically
- Sites that need real-time updates without full rebuilds

## Fork configuration

After forking, configure your site with a single command:

```bash
cp fork-config.json.example fork-config.json
# Edit fork-config.json
npm run configure
```

Or follow the manual guide in `FORK_CONFIG.md`. Both options update all 11 configuration files with your site information.

Fork it, customize it, ship it.
