An open-source publishing framework for AI agents and developers. Write markdown, sync from the terminal. Your content is instantly available to browsers, LLMs, and AI agents. Built on Convex and Netlify.

## What makes it a dev sync system?

**File-based content.** All posts and pages live in `content/blog/` and `content/pages/` as markdown files with frontmatter. No database UI. No admin panel. Just files in your repo.

**CLI publishing workflow.** Write markdown locally, then run `npm run sync` (dev) or `npm run sync:prod` (production). Content appears instantly via Convex real-time sync. Images require git commit and push since they are served as static files from Netlify.

**Sync commands:**

**Development:**
- `npm run sync` - Sync markdown content
- `npm run sync:discovery` - Update discovery files (AGENTS.md, llms.txt)
- `npm run sync:all` - Sync content + discovery files together

**Production:**
- `npm run sync:prod` - Sync markdown content
- `npm run sync:discovery:prod` - Update discovery files
- `npm run sync:all:prod` - Sync content + discovery files together

**Version controlled.** Markdown source files live in your repo alongside code. Commit changes, review diffs, roll back like any codebase. The sync command pushes content to the database.

```bash
# Edit a post, then commit and sync
git add content/blog/my-post.md
git commit -m "Update intro paragraph"
npm run sync        # dev
npm run sync:prod   # production
```

**No admin interface.** No web UI for creating or editing content. You use your code editor and terminal.

## The real-time twist

[![](/images/logos/convex-wordmark-black.svg)](https://convex.dev)

What separates this from a static site generator is the Convex real-time database. Once you sync content:

- All connected browsers update immediately
- No rebuild or redeploy needed
- Search, stats, and RSS update automatically

It's a hybrid: developer workflow for publishing + real-time delivery like a dynamic CMS.

## Fork configuration

After forking, configure your site with a single command:

```bash
cp fork-config.json.example fork-config.json
# Edit fork-config.json
npm run configure
```

Or follow the manual guide in `FORK_CONFIG.md`. Both options update all 11 configuration files with your site information.

Fork it, customize it, ship it.
