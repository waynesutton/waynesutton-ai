Title Ides:
# Disruption starts with sauce
or 
# The defiantion of sauce.

It's first day of 2026! We made it. Another year but this year feels differnt, if you work in tech and are anerpeince entroupere. 

AI is everywehre. Agents, models, imgn-gne. It doesn't matter if you're a full-stack dev, or a vibe coder yo're always one text messag away from from bilding.  It's truly an exicting time tech. You can feel the engery in in SF. Meetups, hackathons, long form articles along with the vibrate detabates of AI replacing the enginner, developers hating the word vibe coding, who's trulley doing 100+ million ARR. All while facing a new uplill problem if you're competing in the attention grabbing world of AI, laucing a SasS, or creating influncer content, and that's distrubtion. 

Everyone knows Distrubtion starts with an audicnen, that turns into a community, that turns into your customers or champions/ambassors, or new hires that ends with everyoen telling everyone how aweosme you or your product is. That's the dream of everyone building today.  

Before the product is built, before the you tweet about your new landing page or before the type your first tprompt, it starts with with foundatasions that helps you stand out among the clouds and that's, your humanity, creativity and passion. That's your sauce.  

We've alaysh hear the quotes, OpenAI just killed xyz startup, or someone else already built it. In both cases, they wouldn't have built it like you would have. Built it with your suance.

humanity, creativity and passion. 

>your humanity, creativity and passion. That's your sauce.  

## Saunce pricplices

### Humanity
  Humanity is your expereoncse, how you see the world, your faviorte music or color. It's also part of your why, what solutiosn do you want to buide and why.

  Example: I wanted to build markdown.fast becuse after years of building wordpress sites, or using other cms that were not ai natfive or slow I wanted a faster experence to publish content using convex. I belived other would befnish from a more modner soluton.  

  If I never had those expereonce of using wordpress or other cms solutions I would have never built a differnt solutoins.

### Creativity
- Think of Creativity as an unlimited supple of colors and emphty colorsing books that are all blank canvases. If you were to pass this out to every sigle person in the world each one would be differnt. This is how I feel with AI, I have access to unlimited coloring books, pens, markers to create art. 

### passion
Yes, passion. Passion is going to be driver to keep your going, learning prompting and trying new ways to build. Passion is going statying up at 11:00 wathing a live stream of Ray, showign how his building apps and trying the difernt models. Passion will have you questiong every sass subcrptions and think you can build the same app, and better with your favtor sstack Passion will hav eyou posting on Twitter(x), linkedin, and bravign reddting about your new app. Passion will to move to SF, apply to YC,attend the meetup or join a hackathon. Passoin will drive you to join a startup.

Humanity, Creativity and Passion, cook with these three and you'll have a great 2026.

Happy New Year!
