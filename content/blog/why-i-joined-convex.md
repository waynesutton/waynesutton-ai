# Why I joined Convex

Last night(October 2025) at the Pre Next.js Conf / Ship AI Meetup in SF, a developer asked why I'm working at Convex instead of another startup or database company.

I smiled because the answer is simple.

**The team.** In the Bay Area, people say Convex has some of the best engineers in tech. We're 20 people, led by founders who built the sync engine at Dropbox. They understand scale and infrastructure better than anyone. And they're good people.

When you find humans you can learn from, enjoy being around, and who do right by their customers, it's a privilege.

**The product.** Convex is a database, but it's more than that. It's a database platform with a short learning curve that helps experienced developers, new developers, and vibe coders ship faster. That benefits both teams and users.

Can your database be your moat? Yes, with Convex.

I've built more than eight apps this year using Convex, and I can immediately tell when other apps are running on outdated libraries and databases. They feel slow and clunky. Many new startups are switching to Convex because they want better dx and what's best for their teams and customers.

**The mission.** Convex's mission is to fundamentally change how software is built on the Internet and who gets to build it.

If you're on some change-the-world energy, this is it. Read that twice. If you've ever built an app with Convex, you already understand.

**The adventure.** Reaching experienced developers and founders while introducing Convex to new ones is like teaching someone to ride a bike. It takes patience, but once they get it, the joy is shared. They remember the experience, tell their friends, and keep building together.

Building communities, startup programs, and supporting founders and developers is rewarding when done with empathy, patience, and education.

Jamie Turner, Convex's co-founder and CEO, recently told a group of startup founders that Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey A. Moore is one of his favorite books. It reminded me of this line:

"The early majority is willing and able to become technologically competent where necessary; the late majority is not."

That quote captures both the challenge and the opportunity we have at Convex with today's developers, engineers, and founders.

And yes, Convex is hiring serious engineers who want to join the adventure: https://www.convex.dev/jobs
