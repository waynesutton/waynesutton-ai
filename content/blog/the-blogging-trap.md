>Beez in the Trap

It's day 2 of 2026 and I still haven't come up with a new year's resolution. And that's okay.

I've been watching the resolutions roll in on Twitter. Jamie Turner, Convex CEO, wants to become a [better storyteller for Convex](https://x.com/jamwt/status/2007148956149805121?s=20). Sherry Jiang announced her [code every day 2026 challenge](https://x.com/SherryYanJiang/status/2007286795952680974?s=20). Both goals are inspirational.

Part of me wants to announce my own: blog every day now that I finally have my site live. Or code every day like Sherry.

But I know me.

I know the weight of "I need to blog every day for the sake of blogging." That pressure takes the fun out of it. The obligation kills the creativity. The streak becomes the point instead of the writing.

## Who am I even blogging for?

I'm blogging for me. I used to blog every day before my unc days and stopped somewhere along the way. Now I have professional development goals around sharing and communicating. That's the why.

What am I going to write about? Everything. AI, life, coding, learning new skills, motorcycle adventure recaps, startup stories. I don't want to put myself in a box. Everything is on the table.

The audience? Myself, first. AI, sure. Coworkers, social media friends, whoever finds this. Truth is, I'm writing for me. But if you're reading this, thanks. Feel free to slide in the DMs.

## The decision

Do I want to blog every day? Yes.

Is it going to be my new year's resolution? No.

Depending on how the sunsets beam in the spring as the seasons change, maybe I'll pick a goal then. But for now, one day at a time.
