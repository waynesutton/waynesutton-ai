It's the first day of 2026. We made it. Another year, but this one feels different if you work in tech or are an experienced entrepreneur.

AI is everywhere. Agents, models, image generation. Doesn't matter if you're a full-stack dev or a vibe coder—you're always one text message away from building. It's an exciting time in tech. You can feel the energy in SF. Meetups, hackathons, long-form articles, and heated debates about AI replacing engineers, developers hating the term "vibe coding," who's actually doing 100+ million ARR. All while facing a new uphill problem if you're competing in the world of AI, launching a SaaS, or creating influencer content: distribution.

Everyone knows distribution starts with an audience that turns into a community, that turns into customers or champions, with outcomes of everyone telling everyone how great you or your product is. That's the dream for anyone building today.

Before the product is built, before you tweet about your new landing page, before you type your first prompt, it starts with foundations that help you stand out among the clouds. Your humanity, creativity, and passion. That's your sauce.

We've always heard the quotes: "OpenAI just killed xyz startup" or "someone else already built it." In both cases, they wouldn't have built it like you would have. With your sauce.

## Sauce principles

### Humanity

Humanity is your experience; how you see the world, your favorite music or color. It's also part of your why. What solutions do you want to build and why?

I wanted to build [markdown.fast](https://markdown.fast) because after years of using or building WordPress sites for others back in the day and using other CMS tools that weren't AI-native or were just slow, I wanted a faster experience to publish content using [Convex](https://convex.dev).  I believed others would benefit from a more modern solution.

If I never had those experiences with WordPress or other CMS solutions, I would have never built something different. Plus I gotta stay up-to-date on my prompt engineering skills.

### Creativity

Think of creativity as an unlimited supply of colors and empty coloring books. Or an empty moleskine. All blank canvases. If you passed these out to every single person in the world, each one would be different. This is how I feel with AI. I have access to unlimited coloring books, pens, and markers to create art or build an app.

### Passion

Yes, passion. Passion is the driver that keeps you going, or prompting, trying new ways to build. Passion is staying up at 11pm watching a livestream of [Ray Fernando](https://x.com/RayFernando1337) showing how he's building apps and trying different AI models. Passion will have you questioning every SaaS subscription thinking you can build the same app, but better with your favorite stack. Passion will have you posting on Twitter (X), LinkedIn, and braving Reddit about your new app. Passion will move you to SF, have you apply to YC, attend the meetup, or join a hackathon. Passion will drive you to join a startup.

Humanity, creativity, and passion. Cook with these three and you'll have a great 2026.

Happy New Year!
